            <h2>Introduction</h2>
          
                <p>
                    The world's oceans are essential for regulating Earth's climate, supporting diverse ecosystems, and sustaining life. Among the 
                    numerous physical and chemical properties of seawater, <strong>salinity</strong> (the concentration of dissolved salts) and 
                    <strong>temperature</strong> play a fundamental role in determining ocean circulation, biological productivity, and heat exchange 
                    between the ocean and atmosphere.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Salinity and temperature are two interconnected parameters that influence the density of seawater. The variations in density, 
                    driven by changes in salinity and temperature, give rise to thermohaline circulation—a major component of the global ocean 
                    conveyor belt. This circulation distributes heat, nutrients, and gases across the globe, regulating regional climates and marine habitats.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Understanding the relationship between salinity and temperature is particularly critical in studying oceanographic processes such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Climate Change:</strong> Rising global temperatures impact evaporation, precipitation, and freshwater input, 
                        which in turn alter salinity patterns and ocean heat content.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Marine Ecosystems:</strong> Salinity and temperature control the habitability of marine environments, influencing 
                        the distribution and diversity of aquatic life.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ocean Currents:</strong> Variations in salinity and temperature drive the thermohaline circulation, impacting 
                        surface and deep ocean currents that shape regional and global climates.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>
                    This research focuses on analyzing the relationship between salinity and temperature in oceanographic data collected from the 
                    <strong>California Current System (CCS)</strong>. The CCS is one of the most dynamic and productive marine ecosystems, extending 
                    along the western coast of North America. It is influenced by complex interactions between atmospheric conditions, ocean currents, 
                    and freshwater inputs.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    By combining statistical analysis and data visualization techniques, this project investigates how salinity and temperature 
                    are correlated in the CCS. The study uses datasets from <em>CalCOFI</em> (California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations), 
                    a long-term oceanographic research program that provides high-quality measurements for ocean climate and marine biology research.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The insights derived from this analysis are expected to contribute to a better understanding of regional oceanographic processes, 
                    provide baseline data for future climate studies, and support marine resource management efforts.
                </p>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                The analysis involves two key datasets: 
                <strong>bottle data</strong> containing salinity and temperature readings, and 
                <strong>station metadata</strong> providing identifiers for each measurement point. 
                The datasets are merged, cleaned, and validated for consistency before analysis.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The analysis reveals a positive correlation between salinity and temperature, suggesting that changes in salinity 
                may be used as predictors for temperature variations. These findings contribute to understanding oceanographic 
                processes and their broader implications for climate studies.
